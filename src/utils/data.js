The second example I put together why it's ranked teams using out and using specific topics of Interest or customer Refinery bcba, and they're really awesome at putting together playlist based off of different topics for maybe the content expert or Founders or Venture Capital. They put this playlist together and then they're able to share those out based off of the jeans that are created inside captain at 3, but have to measure what the performance looks like for those. A customer HubSpot is Austin doing something really cool one of their show host of one of their shows is written a book and what they did was they took experts from the episodes from her shell every time she mention the book they would put together and add that episode into a playlist so that when her book came out of his published they did a PR a press release regarding it with that playlist included about what her journey was. I'm building out and writing that book. So it was really cool to promote it with that playlist of smaller Experts of the episodes that focused on that. And thirdly another way to use playlist is El Chapo's security is using it boy every time someone wants to get to know and understand what it looks like to put together maybe a cyber risk management program has gone ahead and take in the episodes from their shows that pertains that particular piece of how to do this. What makes sense how to get started so that they can be able to create and listen to that playlist and then they have a security can be able to see who it is. That's actually listening who's reasoning and and taking away note the content and be able to understand who that person is maybe so they can reach out or maybe it's just allowing them to be able to vote content-aware. They might not have been found before they can be able to use that to bring on new customers and new business for them. So hopefully that gives you some insight into some fun ways that our customers part of the cast of playlist is also just like I said repurposing an amplifying your best content to ensure the return on your creativity and using it towards those abmp opinions much like what tribe is doing and also creating the content collection for your Target in content and then allows you to easily internally and externally I using it for existing content as well. Taking a minute to look there we go. We want to build up the anticipation in the hype. So one of the ways that we're hoping that our customers see that playlist allows them to reach the audience since I'm hoping and wishing like, oh, I hope this gets to the right person at the right time actually playlist you're able to segment and used your audience to understand, you know, who is listening focus on maybe particular topics of interest to focus on Stern selections of your audience in your customer base, and then allows you off to be to create an unlimited on a shareable playlist that you can use over and over but also the breadth and depth of playlist. It is so much that you can build as many as you would like It also takes the stress out of baby up. So like I said earlier, you know the hoping in the wishing it actually allows you to harness your content and build out those campaigns using cast it to be able to measure look at your performance as well as see. Okay. Well who is consumed consuming the content may be what are the most prominent ways? Maybe it would be the most takeaways in the playlist that we're putting together. What's the most popular what's the most interesting at to our customers and Prospects so that we know how to reach out to them and can gauge interest that way. So I think what I'm going to do is go ahead and take it away and be able to show us a little bit about playlist in the live demo. Yeah sure and let me get that started here. ",

So we're excited to talk about cast of playlist. This really helps that you're content further and ultimately do with that. I'm going to give it over to Cara Bonita Vista with content and Captain was be able to create small bite-sized selections of audio and video content. Our customers needed a way to be able to create a smaller playlist be able to focus on particular topics beam as well as have creative ways of sharing it and measure the performance. So what came about from hearing that from customers was creating playlist and it actually ended up being our top customer request. Pretty much for a long span of time until we are able to develop it. But what we found was our customers really have latched on to it and we see if some really cool use cases. So I want to share a couple of those with you to get your mind percolating and see how you guys might be able to use playlist and think about it. Love it differently. The first example I put together ways from our customer Mosser Consulting how they're using playlist is by repurposing and reusing and amplifying their content when they're taking a Hiatus for a brake not everybody goes on for a full year of content and they like to take to her breaks throughout the year to Witt playlist allow them to do is be able to create different collections if they're doing being out of the office type of playlist. Hey, we're out. We're taking a two-week break take a look and listen to the show that might be from our favorite industry experts or Hades are season recap see what season or what show is might speak to you the most and be able to give it a listen. So having the smaller selections allow them to be able to take that time off to regroup and get creative again and still be able to pump out that content. ",

So what's great about Cassidy this content at us like any of your other episodes or regular collection pages are? Hi to your serum so we can go all the way down to contact level. If you have your CRM and marketing automation platform hooked up. So think of spot or keto what's really powerful is that we can also identify folks who are not identified by Cookie. So wherever they're listening will convert the IP address into an account. So this can be really powerful as you can imagine. We can an ATM space where were able to collect or really important information that we think will be key to capturing the hearts and Minds attention of our key accounts can actually use is a cat's the inside to see ya. In fact the brains that were targeting better in our target audience. They are in fact listening to episodes playlist. So you kept both the ability to create content for target audience and also you get to measure that those Target audiences her reached Great. Here's one of our differences. And where is this would be used for long-form Content versus Clips their Castle. Yeah, so what's really powerful with playlist is he can collect together lots of different types of content so it can be a great way to blend together longer conversations with or quick moments that you want to share with your audience think of it alot helps us go down that path towards and Netflix. It says are all about looking through the different content that they might find interesting and playlist is another way for you to do that to help us discover the concept that they may be looking for.

I've currently selected for episodes that I know are top-ranking and really high-performing interviews that we've completed. It's so what we're going to do today as we going to look for another. Another podcast where we can add to my list and so you can see here's what I'm looking for. We have our Zoom info interview with paintball Tire we can add that to playlist and just as easy as that we were able to find another episode an added. Of course I can drag and drop these in any order that I like was cool. As this is using are very powerful search engine as I mentioned. So you have all the same power that you do with cast search where we can refine. Oz you a theme which will come back to you as we can use our tags and we can also terrifying by specific show. So if we know that we wanted to pick up an episode out of a particular collection inside a cat's it may be that the cast of podcast we can refine down on the right side. That's the only show just those items. I'm already you can save that playlist and we can share it. So we'll grab a link which I have opened up here and you can see our playlist are built out for us ready to go. All the key takeaways that you clipped and created for these episodes are ready. And if the following episodes are tied together again into that playlist section. So that's a singer playlist pretty easy to create really powerful, but we can go one step further using the power of cast and themes we can actually create a new playlist. That's Dynamic. ",
